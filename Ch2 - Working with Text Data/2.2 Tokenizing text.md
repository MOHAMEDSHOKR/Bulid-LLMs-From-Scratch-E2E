# 2.2 Tokenizing text
### Let’s discuss how we split input text into individual tokens, a required preprocessing
step for creating embeddings for an LLM. These tokens are either individual words or
special characters, including punctuation characters, as shown in figure 2.4.

input text into individual tokens, which are either words or special characters, such as
punctuation characters.

The text we will tokenize for LLM training is “The Verdict,” a short story by Edith
Wharton, which has been released into the public domain and is thus permitted to be
used for LLM training tasks. The text is available on Wikisource at https://en.wikisource
.org/wiki/The_Verdict, and you can copy and paste it into a text file, which I copied
into a text file "the-verdict.txt".
Alternatively, you can find this "the-verdict.txt" file in this book’s GitHub
repository at https://mng.bz/Adng. You can download the file with the following
Python code:

import urllib.request
url = ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rasbt/"
"LLMs-from-scratch/main/ch02/01_main-chapter-code/"
"the-verdict.txt")
file_path = "the-verdict.txt"
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, file_path)

Next, we can load the the-verdict.txt file using Python’s standard file reading utilities.
