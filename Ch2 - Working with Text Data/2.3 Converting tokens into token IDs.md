#### Next, letâ€™s convert these tokens from a Python string to an integer representation to produce the token IDs. 
This conversion is an intermediate step before converting the token IDs into embedding vectors.
To map the previously generated tokens into token IDs, we have to build a vocabulary
first. This vocabulary defines how we map each unique word and special character
to a unique integer, as shown in figure 2.6.
