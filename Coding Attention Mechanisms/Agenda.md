# This chapter covers
 ### * The reasons for using attention mechanisms inneural networks.
### * A basic self-attention framework, progressing to an enhanced self-attention mechanism.
### * A causal attention module that allows LLMs to generate one token at a time.
### * Masking randomly selected attention weights with dropout to reduce overfitting.
### * Stacking multiple causal attention modules into a multi-head attention module.
