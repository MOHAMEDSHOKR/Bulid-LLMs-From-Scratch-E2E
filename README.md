# LLMs-From-Scratch-
Building a Large Language Model (From Scratch) to understand and create your own GPT-like large language models (LLMs) from the ground up.
It begins by focusing on the fundamentals of working with text data and coding attention mechanisms 
and then guides you through implementing a complete GPT model from scratch.
The book then covers the pretraining mechanism as well as
fine-tuning for specific tasks such as text classification and following instructions. 
By the end of this book, you’ll have a deep understanding of how LLMs work and the skills to build your own models.
While the models you’ll create are smaller in scale compared to the large foundational models, 
they use the same concepts and serve as powerful educational tools to grasp the core mechanisms and techniques
used in building state-of-the-art LLMs.
